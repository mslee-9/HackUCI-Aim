Aim is a community platform used for people who want to achieve similar goals (either personal or social good). It allows individuals to hold themselves and their peers accountable when creating goals for themselves or for the community. The platform allows users to create their own goals for other people to commit to and for users to join other goals they wish to commit to. It is a simple to use platform to ensure it is not overwhelming. With some which are timed dates and others that are not, it forces individuals out of their bed and onto creating a better world for themselves.

We used React.js to build the front end using CSS and HTML and we used Javascript, along with Mangoose, to build the backend
